"abstract": "The objective of any anomaly detection system is to efficiently detect several types of malicious traffic patterns that cannot be detected by conventional firewall systems. Designing an efficient intrusion detection system has three primary challenges that include addressing high dimensionality problem, choice of learning algorithm, and distance or similarity measure used to find the similarity value between any two traffic patterns or input observations. Feature representation and dimensionality reduction have been studied and addressed widely in the literature and have also been applied for the design of intrusion detection systems (IDS). The choice of classifiers is also studied and applied widely in the design of IDS. However, at the heart of IDS lies the choice of distance measure that is required for an IDS to judge an incoming observation as normal or abnormal. This challenge has been understudied and relatively less addressed in the research literature both from academia and from industry. This research aims at introducing a novel distance measure that can be used to perform feature clustering and feature representation for efficient intrusion detection. Recent studies such as CANN proposed feature reduction techniques for improving detection and accuracy rates of IDS that used Euclidean distance. However, accuracies of attack classes such as U2R and R2L are not significantly promising. Our approach GARUDA is based on clustering feature patterns incrementally and then representing features in different transformation space through using a novel fuzzy Gaussian dissimilarity measure. Experiments are conducted on both KDD and NSL-KDD datasets. The accuracy and detection rates of proposed approach are compared for classifiers such as kNN, J48, na√Øve Bayes, along with CANN and CLAPP approaches. Experiment results proved that proposed approach resulted in the improved accuracy and detection rates for U2R and R2L attack classes when compared to other approaches.",

"abstract": "Software-Defined Network (SDN) has become a promising network architecture in current days that provide network operators more control over the network infrastructure. The controller, also called as the operating system of the SDN, is responsible for running various network applications and maintaining several network services and functionalities. Despite all its capabilities, the introduction of various architectural entities of SDN poses many security threats and potential targets. Distributed Denial of Services (DDoS) is a rapidly growing attack that poses a tremendous threat to the Internet. As the control layer is vulnerable to DDoS attacks, the goal of this paper is to detect the attack traffic, by taking the centralized control aspect of SDN. Nowadays, in the field of SDN, various machine learning (ML) techniques are being deployed for detecting malicious traffic. Despite these works, choosing the relevant features and accurate classifiers for attack detection is an open question. For better detection accuracy, in this work, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is assisted by kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) with genetic algorithm (GA). In the proposed SVM model, KPCA is used for reducing the dimension of feature vectors, and GA is used for optimizing different SVM parameters. In order to reduce the noise caused by feature differences, an improved kernel function (N-RBF) is proposed. The experimental results show that compared to single-SVM, the proposed model achieves more accurate classification with better generalization. Moreover, the proposed model can be embedded within the controller to define security rules to prevent possible attacks by the attackers.",

"abstract": "Outlier temporal pattern mining problem is the study and discovery of abnormal, invalid, anomalous temporal patterns in a given temporal database. In this paper, we address the approach for mining of outlier temporal patterns with respect to a given threshold and reference. To verify if the given pattern is an outlier pattern, we compute the true support of temporal pattern and then obtain the distance between this pattern and reference temporal pattern using a novel measure. If the threshold distance computed using the proposed measure exceeds the minimum threshold limit, the pattern is treated as an outlier. Discovery and prediction of repeating temporal patterns and understanding the behavior of temporal pattern trends is quite challenging in the case of time stamped temporal datasets. At present, existing algorithms for temporal pattern mining do not have methods to reveal pattern which are emerging, seasonal and diminishing. Determining similar temporal patterns and unearthing eccentric patterns require an efficient dissimilarity measure. This research addresses the similarity measure for revealing outlier temporal patterns.",
