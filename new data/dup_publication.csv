The most common threats that we encounter on the internet are Malicious URLs and Malware.Traditional solutions for combating these threats, are to build a databases of known sources of trouble or/and using filters to restrict access to resources. This is however not dynamic enough to detect attacks of smart Cyber-criminals. Techniques such as type-squatting, domain-squatting , code obfuscation,etc are hard to identify using conventional methods. Thus to stay one step ahead in the war against Cyber-crime we need to use Machine and Deep learning enabled methods in our defense equipment . The tool Malware and Malicious URL Classifier (MAMUC) is a unique tool which has 3 features. The first feature helps us to identify if a given URL is malicious or benign. This classifier runs on a novel Malben dateset. The second feature is used to covert a malware sample from byte-code to its corresponding malware image. This called as malware visualization,which is a strategy used in static malware inspection. The third feature of the tool is a malware classifier. Once malware is converted to an image ,its analysis is simplified to a case of image classification. This part identifies to which family an input malware is most closely associated with. Once the malware family is identified it is easier to deal with it. The novelty we have employed in this classifier is the use of Dual channel CNN(DCCNN) algorithm for malware classification","Malware visualization, URL classification , Malware classification,Deep Learning, DCCNN .",,,,2021-10-01,,,

Temporal association pattern discovery is extended to similarity based temporal association pattern discovery from time-stamped transaction databases by Sashi Sekhar, Yoo using methods to estimate support limits and distance limits of temporal item sets. Yoo also introduced methods for pruning using distance bounds and proposed SEQUENTIAL, SPAMINE approaches. Our previous research introduced algorithms G-SPAMINE, MASTER, Z-SPAMINE for time profiled association pattern discovery that applied distance measures SRIHASS, ASTRA, GARUDA, and KRISHNA SUDARSANA for similarity computations. SEQUENTIAL, SPAMINE, G-SPAMINE, MASTER, Z-SPAMINE approaches are all based on snapshot and lattice database scan strategies that prune itemsets making use of estimated support and distance values. The major limitation of all these algorithms is their inevitability to eliminate database scanning process for knowing true supports of itemsets. To eliminate the requirement of retaining database in main memory in order to know true supports, VRKSHA and GANDIVA are two pioneering research that introduced tree structure for time profiled association mining. VRKSHA is based on snapshot tree scan technique while GANDIVA is lattice tree scan based approach. VRKSHA and GANDIVA both apply Euclidean distance function but does not estimate support and distance bounds. This research introduced the pioneering work ULTIMATE that uses a novel tree structure generated using similarity measure ASTRA and applies support and distance bound computations for pruning temporal patterns. Experiment results showed that ULTIMATE outperforms SEQUENTIAL, SPAMINE, G-SPAMINE, MASTER, VRKSHA, GANDIVA algorithms.","distance, temporal, association, discovery, research, support, tree, based, introduced, gandiva",,,VRK-C076,2018-10-01,,,

Learning process helps the discovery of hidden, valuable and important information that can provide insightful results. Imputation is a data pre-processing task that requires applying distance function to find missing values. In this paper, a distance function named MANTRA is proposed to impute missing data values. The distance function is also called as the imputation measure since it is designed for imputation of missing values. A working example is demonstrated that shows how imputation is achieved using proposed distance function, MANTRA. It is proved that the nominal value that is filled after imputation is same as the original.","Medical records, missing values, data imputation, supervised learning, unsupervised learning, hidden information, data pre-processing, distance function, MANTRA, imputation measure, working example, nominal value, original value.",,,VRK-C075,2018-10-01,,,

However, IoT area is still not matured and is throwing light on lot of research issues towards the data mining researchers. Security in IoT throws several challenges because of limited resources. In this context, IoT gains importance once again from data miners towards anomaly mining or intrusion detection. Intrusion detection is classified as NP-class in the literature even today. Algorithms addressing privacy and security issues in IoT must consider the complexities involved and hence require re-attention from all researchers. One more problem faced when judging for intrusion is the use of high dimensionality, classifier choice, and distance measure. For example, the traditional distance measure, such as Euclidean misjudges the similarity. In this paper, the objective is to design a fuzzy membership function to address both dimensionality and anomaly mining so as reduce the computational complexity and increase computational accuracies of classifier algorithms. We validate the proposed measure using several experimentations on NSL-KDD and DARPA datasets using kNN, J48 and CANN using Gaussian measure.

Detecting arrhythmia from ECG signals is considered a standard approach and hence, automating this process would aid the diagnosis by providing fast, cost-efficient, and accurate solutions at scale. This is executed by extracting the definite properties from the individual patterns collected from Electrocardiography (ECG) signals causing arrhythmia. In this era of applied intelligence, automated detection and diagnostic solutions are widely used for their spontaneous and robust solutions. In this research, our contributions are two-fold. Firstly, the Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform (DT-CWT) method is implied to overhaul shift-invariance and aids signal reconstruction to extract significant features. Next, A neural attention mechanism is implied to capture temporal patterns from the extracted features of the ECG signal to discriminate distinct classes of arrhythmia and is trained end-to-end with the finest parameters. To ensure that the models generalizability, a set of five train-test variants are implied. The proposed model attains the highest accuracy of 98.5% for classifying 8 variants of arrhythmia on the MIT-BIH dataset. To test the resilience of the model, the unseen (test) samples are increased by 5x and the deviation in accuracy score and MSE was 0.12% and 0.1% respectively. Further, to assess the diagnostic model performance, AUC-ROC curves are plotted. At every test level, the proposed model is capable of generalizing new samples and leverages the advantage to develop a real-world application.

Traditionally IDSs (Intrusion detection systems) have been developed by applying machine learning techniques and adopted single learning mechanism. This is later extended by developing Intrusion Detection Systems by adopting multiple learning mechanisms. Such systems have addressed better detection rates compared to single learning Intrusion Detection Systems. Dimensionality is one more serious concern which affects the performance of classification algorithms. Approaches such as ""Feature selection"" have been studied and adopted which selects a subset features from the feature set. However, the feature extraction approach for dimensionality reduction has proved to be better compared to feature selection and achieved better classification and detection rates. In this research, we address ""Feature extraction"" using ""Evolutionary feature clustering"" by proposing a ""Novel fuzzy membership function"" which addresses Dimensionality Reduction (DR). The idea is to transform the initial connection representation so that its equivalent representation has reduced noise affect and achieves better classification or detection rates. Experimental results on KDD datasets with 19 and 41 attributes, prove that the proposed approach has improved detection rates for R2L and U2R attack classes when compared to CANN, CLAPP, and SVM approaches. CANN approach recorded lower detection rates w.r.t U2R and R2L attacks.

However, IoT area is still not matured and is throwing light on lot of research issues towards the data mining researchers. Security in IoT throws several challenges because of limited resources. In this context, IoT gains importance once again from data miners towards anomaly mining or intrusion detection. Intrusion detection is classified as NP-class in the literature even today. Algorithms addressing privacy and security issues in IoT must consider the complexities involved and hence require re-attention from all researchers. One more problem faced when judging for intrusion is the use of high dimensionality, classifier choice, and distance measure. For example, the traditional distance measure, such as Euclidean misjudges the similarity. In this paper, the objective is to design a fuzzy membership function to address both dimensionality and anomaly mining so as reduce the computational complexity and increase computational accuracies of classifier algorithms.

Datasets generated in an IoT environment usually have missing values. The presence of missing values makes the classifier unsuitable for classification task. This article introduces (a) a novel imputation technique for imputation of missing data values (b) a classifier which is based on feature transformation to perform classification (c) imputation measure for similarity computation between any two instances that can also be used as similarity measure. The performance of proposed classifier is studied by using imputed datasets obtained through applying Kmeans, F-Kmeans and proposed imputation methods.

The problem of the network anomaly detection is to determine, if the network incoming traffic is legitimate (or) anomalous. Automated detection systems designed to identify incoming anomalous traffic patterns usually apply widely used machine learning techniques. However, irrespective of any system model which is developed to identify anomalous traffic, all these models requires comparing anomalous and normal traffic patterns. Such comparisons implicitly depend on the ability of the underlying machine learning model to gauge the similarity between a known legitimate observation and the target. The efficiency of any network anomalous detection system depends on the use of distance (or) similarity measures and how they are actually applied. A novel distance function which can be applied to determine the similarity between two conditional feature pattern vectors is an important contribution of present research. Feature dimensionality is another important issue for any machine learning algorithm. In the present work, feature reduction is achieved using the proposed feature transformation technique. However, our approach for feature transformation uses the proposed gaussian distance function to achieve dimensionality reduction to represent the original input dataset in the new transformation space. We have also proposed new computation expressions for determining equivalent deviation and threshold in gaussian space. Experiments are performed on KDD and NSL-KDD datasets by considering widely applied classifier algorithms in various state-of-art research contributions. For performance validation of machine learning models, k-fold cross validation is applied by setting k to 10 through considering evaluation parameters such as accuracy, precision and recall. Experiment results have proved that our approach for anomaly detection that applies the proposed feature transformation technique proved comparatively better to detection methods CANN, GARUDA, and UTTAMA addressed in the recent research literature","Similarity function,

Typically agriculturalists or specialists perceive the plants with a naked eye for detection and identification of an illness. Machine vision models, in specific Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have directed an impact in feature extraction to a greater extent. Since 2015, numerous solicitations for the automatic classification and recognition of crop illnesses have been established.

Methods: In this paper, we proposed, analyzed, and assessed various state-of-the-art models proposed over a decade. These models are pre-trained with the finest parameters where we modeled a design-oriented method with numerous leaf-images and classified them into infection and healthy class for each type of leaf independently.
Results: Through our examination, we concluded that VGG models stand-alone with many cited prototypes and give on par results. As declared, these VGG models (VGG16 and VGG19) are utilized for feature extraction, and further, we augmented a set of dense layers and train them consequently for classification. The performances of various machine vision prototypes were pictorially perceived and their sophisticated architecture is not only capable of extracting detailed features but also repressed many loop-holes. The performance is assessed and computed for several types of leaf images and the accuracy scores attained were more than 97.5% for VGG16 and 96.72% for VGG19.
Conclusion: AUC-ROC curves were portrayed to illustrate its inspiration in defining an accurate classification where VGG16 and VGG19 have at least 96.6% and 95% area under the curve (AUC) which resembles their robustness."," Leaf classification, deep learning, transfer learning, automated plant diagnosis, CNNs",,,,2020-08-01,,,

The manual detection and identification of the plant diseases require a careful and observative examination through expertise. To overcome manual testing procedures an automated identification and detection can be implied which provides faster, scalable and precisive solutions. In this research, the contributions of our work are threefold. Firstly, a bi-linear convolution neural network (Bi-CNNs) for plant leaf disease identification and classification is proposed. Secondly, we fine-tune VGG and pruned ResNets and utilize them as feature extractors and connect them to fully connected dense networks. The hyperparameters are tuned to reach faster convergence and obtain better generalization during stochastic optimization of Bi-CNN(s). Finally, the proposed model is designed to leverage scalability by implying the Bi-CNN model into a real-world application and release it as an open-source. The model is designed on variant testing criteria ranging from 10% to 50%. These models are evaluated on gold-standard classification measures. To study the performance, testing samples were expanded by 5x (i.e., from 10% to 50%) and it is found that the deviation in the accuracy was quite low (0.27%) which resembles the consistent generalization ability.

A reliable healthcare system ensures a strong economy by increasing life expectancy, contributing to national growth, and reducing the burden of families. The purpose of this project is to implement a proper healthcare management system integrating all the basic functionalities powered by an Artificial Intelligent chatbot that is capable of having a very organic conversation with the user and solving their queries using knowledge base. The knowledge base is a real-time data collected in a JSON format which is pre-processed to make it ready for further processing using bag of words. The information is received and delivered in both speech and text formats. The chatbot can provide navigation links according to the requests of a user. Furthermore, it is capable of predicting the problem by performing symptom diagnosis and recommending a doctor to be consulted or any immediate measures to be taken. In addition, it also provides information regarding diagnostics beforehand.","Chatbot,
